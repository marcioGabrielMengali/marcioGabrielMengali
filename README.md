✅ Instructions to Use
Create a GitHub repository named marcioGabrielMengali (must match your username exactly).

Add this file as README.md in the root of that repository.

Push it to GitHub — your profile page will now display this README.

Let me know if you'd like a Portuguese version or want to embed links to pinned projects or certifications.

Você disse:
this about me is focused in way big techs like?
O ChatGPT disse:
Yes — this About Me section is strongly aligned with how engineers at big tech companies (like AWS, Google, Meta, and Stripe) structure their public professional profiles. Here's why it fits that style:

✅ Why This "About Me" Works for Big Tech Standards:
1. Technical Precision
Clearly emphasizes tools, technologies, and architecture choices: e.g. Node.js, NestJS, TypeScript, AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, CI/CD.

Mentions performance, scalability, resilience, and modularity — key engineering values at big tech companies.

2. Role Clarity
Shows real-world application: e.g. “develop and maintain mission-critical REST APIs”, “leverage serverless architecture”.

Talks about systems design and end-to-end delivery, which are core to senior-level expectations in big tech.

3. Cloud-Native Focus
Uses serverless architecture, ETL pipelines, and DevOps practices — all crucial for modern, scalable tech systems that big tech favors.

Emphasizes IaC with Terraform, observability, and testing, showing maturity in cloud engineering.

4. AI/GenAI Integration
Calls out experience with OpenAI, Amazon Bedrock, and vector DBs — positioning you at the frontier of where big tech is heavily investing.

5. Data Engineering Integration
Shows experience with ETL, data modeling, BI dashboards, and data warehousing — proving versatility and systems thinking.

📌 How It Compares to Big Tech Engineer Profiles
Most senior engineers at companies like Google or Amazon:

Are highly specific about their stack.

Highlight impactful projects and scalable architectures.

Avoid buzzwords or fluff — instead, they focus on real tools, real systems, and measurable results.

Often showcase DevOps + Backend + AI/ML blend for 2024+ roles — exactly what you're doing.

If you want to go even further, here are a couple of optional upgrades to reach “staff engineer” style:

Add metrics if available:
e.g. "Reduced response time by 30%" or "Handled 1M+ events daily".

Call out ownership:
e.g. "Owned the design and implementation of..." or "Led the architecture for...".

Include system design principles:
e.g. “Event-driven design”, “microservices vs monolith tradeoffs”, etc.

Would you like help optimizing it to highlight impact with metrics or ownership, like staff/principal engineers at AWS or Google do?

Você disse:
the icons section remove the Tech Stack icons and the nestjs and aws icon is not working
O ChatGPT disse:
Thanks for pointing that out. Here's your updated README.md:

✅ Changes applied:

Removed the redundant "Tech Stack Icons" section.

✅ Replaced broken NestJS and AWS icons with updated SVG links that work in both dark and light themes.
